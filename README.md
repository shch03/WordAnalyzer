# WordAnalyzer
A Word Analyzer analyzes any word and determine number of consonants and vowels. You need to develop a simple React Native mobile application that analyzes any word given by a user. 

1. User inputs a word into the box
2. Click the analyze button
3. the given word will be stored in the variable 'value'
4. variable 'characters' and 'consonant' will store the word length of the variable 'value'
5. then, arr_word will store each letter of the word in an array
6. The first For loop is to loop arr_word array
7. Second for loop is to loop existing listVowel to compare with arr_word
8. if the letter arr_word is in the listVowel, then the vowel variable will be added by 1 and the consonant variable will be subtracted by 1
9. Finally, the variable characters, consonants, vowels, values will be displayed on the screen

//this code still has error, the loop only counts the first consonant letter so the result shown is not correct
